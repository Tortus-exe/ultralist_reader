# Tort's Todo List Application
This is a todo list application with functionality based on ultralist. As such, it follows the Getting Things Done philosophy as well. I have added a few features which I believe do not overcomplicate the todo list but improve the quality of life.

# Todos:
- [ ] Make listing todos not list groups that have only archived todos
- [ ] Add "archive completed todos" functionality
- [ ] Add garbage collection (delete all completed todos)
